<h1>Prometheus - Getting started</h1>

<p>
The simplest way to start learning Prometheus is to install it in your laptop
and see what it's all about. You can use it as a monitoring tool for your machine.
So let's do that.
</p>

<h2>Download the thing</h2>

<p>
Go to its <a href="https://prometheus.io/download">download page</a>
and find the <strong>prometheus</strong> section. You will find there the tar.gz file for
Linux, Mac, and Windows. Download the one that suits your machine's OS. Mine is
Mac so I will download the Darwin file. Just downloaded, now I have
<strong>prometheus-2.53.0.darwin-amd64.tar.gz</strong> file in my machine.
</p>

<h2>Extract and check the file</h2>

<p>Now using command line:</p>

<pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0">
<code class="language-bash">
$ tar xzvf prometheus-2.53.0.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
</code>
</pre>

<p>
There is a new directory named <strong>prometheus-2.53.0.darwin-amd64</strong> in my
<strong>Downloads</strong> directory now. I am moving it to my <strong>~/opt</strong> for convenience.
</p>

<pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0">
<code class="language-bash">
$ mv prometheus-2.53.0.darwin-amd64 ~/opt/prometheus
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Inside <strong>~/opt/prometheus</strong> you should have <strong>prometheus</strong> binary and its config
file, <strong>prometheus.yml</strong>. The important thing to know for now is that to run
prometheus we need a configuration file and we are going to use that yaml file
as our configuration file.
</p>

<h2>Run it and browse the metrics</h2>

<p>
Now from inside <strong>~/opt/prometheus</strong> directory run the binary.
</p>

<pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0">
<code class="language-bash">
$ ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Open your preferred browser and access <strong>http://localhost:9090</strong>. You now have prometheus UI in your browser.
</p>

<p>
But what metrics are available? Where are they coming from? Check the targets
scraped by Prometheus by clicking <strong>Status</strong> at the top menu and then click
<strong>Targets</strong>.

<h2>Config file</h2>

<p>
To understand why you have 1 target the first time you run prometheus,
read the content of <strong>prometheus.yml</strong> file.
</p>

<pre class="language-yaml" tabindex="0">
<code class="language-yaml">
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          # - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first_rules.yml"
  # - "second_rules.yml"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: "prometheus"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
</code>
</pre>

<p>
At the top level there are 4 fields: <code>global</code>, <code>alerting</code>, <code>rule_files</code>, and
<code>scrape_configs</code>. Ignore <code>alerting</code> and <code>rule_files</code> for now. If you check the
value <code>alerting</code>, the <code>targets</code> itself is empty. The same with <code>rule_files</code>. And
we don't need them for now.
</p>

<p>
The values in <code>global</code> are the default value for the rest of configuration when
it applies. Inside <code>scraper_configs</code> there are items, each of them is a scrape
config. Currently we have 1 item in <code>scrape_configs</code>, a scrape config with
<code>prometheus</code> as the <code>job_name</code>. Let's change the value of <code>job_name</code> to <code>prome</code>.
Stop the currently running prometheus in your terminal by pressing Ctrl-C. And
run it back. It will use the updated config file.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We conclude the post for now because it will be too long and too boring to read.
In the next post I will write about the metrics provided by prometheus itself.
Then after that we will install prometheus' node exporter to monitoring our
local machine/laptop/PC.
