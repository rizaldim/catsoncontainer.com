<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
If we use MongoDB Atlas, the connection string provided to be used to connect
the cluster is using
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format">SRV connection format</a>.
So instead of using <code>mongodb://</code> in the connection string, it will be <code>mongodb+srv://</code>.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of using this is that if I have a MongoDB replica set with 3 nodes,
using the standard connection format (the <code>mongodb://</code> one) I will set the
connection string like this:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    mongodb://username:password@db-1.example.com:27017,db-2.example.com:27017,db-3.example.com:27017/db?authSource=admin&amp;replicaSet=myRepl
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
I think I can leave out the port to make it shorter, I am not sure. But yeah
it's a bit too long. It's possible to just mention 1 node instead of all three
but it's not recommended. If I use the <code>db-1.example.com</code> one and then that
node is down then the db client will not be able to find the rest of the
replica set and it will not be able to connect to it.
</p>

<p>Using SRV connection format, I can use something like this:</p>

<pre>
  <code>mongodb+srv://username:password@db-rs.example.com/db</code>
</pre>

<p>
So how does it work really? Seems like there is less information in that connection string
and somehow it works. The client can find out all of the nodes inside the replica set
and the parameters used for the connection string.
</p>

<h2>SRV DNS record</h2>

<p>
Turns out there is a type of DNS record called SRV.
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-srv-record/">This page in Cloudflare learning site</a>
explains it well. In summary this type of record is a DNS service record, hence
the name SRV I assume. The format is the following:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>_service._proto.name. TTL class type of record priority weight port target.</code>
</pre>

<p>
So let's say that I have a MongoDB replica set. It has 3 nodes. The nodes are
accessible using these addresses: <strong>rs-node-1.rizaldi.net</strong>, <strong>rs-node-2.rizaldi.net</strong>, and
<strong>rs-node-3.rizaldi.net</strong>. I want this replica set to be accessible through
<strong>db.rizaldi.net</strong> domain. For this I will create 3 DNS records with type SRV for
the host <strong>_mongodb._tcp.db.rizaldi.net</strong>. The way to create these records will probably differ
for each DNS manager that you use. In Porkbun it looks like the following.
</p>

    alt="Form to add SRV record in Porkbun"
    width="1676"
    height="1100"
  >
</picture>

<p>
Using the above form for my use case, I will need to create 3 DNS records. For
the first one I will fill in the form with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: _mongodb._tcp.db.rizaldi.net</li>
  <li><strong>Answer/Value</strong>: <code>0 27017 rs-node-1.rizaldi.net</code></li>
  <li><strong>Priority</strong>: 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
The other two records will be the same except for the <code>rs-node-1</code> part. It will
be <code>rs-node-2</code> and <code>rs-node-3</code> respectively.
</p>

<p>
Why do I use 0 for priority and weight? To be honest I just copy the setup from
MongoDB Atlas. When I queried the DNS record for my MongoDB Atlas cluster's DNS
I found that it uses 0 as priority and weight. I haven't experimented with
changing the values yet.
</p>

<h2>Additional TXT record</h2>

<p>
Another thing to note is that MongoDB client will also look for a TXT record
for the domain used in the connection string. The value of this TXT record will
be the parameter of the connection string. For my sample use case I need to add
a TXT record for <code>db.rizaldi.net</code> with value <code>authSource=admin&amp;replicaSet=rs0</code>.
This is to tell the MongoDB client to use <code>admin</code> database as the
authentication database and the name of replica set is <code>rs0</code>.
</p>

<h2>The implied tls parameter</h2>

<p>
When I did the experiment of setting up the DNS for MongoDB replica set, I
still couldn't connect to the replica set even though I was sure that I already
configured the DNS records in the correct way.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is I could connect to the replica set using standard MongoDB
connection string, by mentioning one or all the nodes of the replica set in the
connection string.
</p>

<p>
To investigate it I run a python script that I found in
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/srv-connection-strings/">MongoDB developer site</a>.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
import srvlookup #pip install srvlookup
import sys
import dns.resolver #pip install dnspython

host = None

if len(sys.argv) > 1 :
   host = sys.argv[1]

if host :
   services = srvlookup.lookup("mongodb", domain=host)
   for i in services:
      print("%s:%i" % (i.hostname, i.port))
   for txtrecord in dns.resolver.query(host, 'TXT'):
      print("%s: %s" % ( host, txtrecord))

else:
  print("No host specified")

</code>
</pre>

<p>
I ran the script first using my MongoDB Atlas cluster domain as host. Then using
my newly setup MongoDB replica set as host. Then I compared the result. From my
understanding my setup should work since the output of the script is as expected.
</p>

<p>
Then I got an idea to run a simple javascript program for connecting the replica
set. The script is from the MongoDB official node client's README file with
some modifications.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript" tabindex="0">
<code class="language-javascript">
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb+srv://user:pass@db.rizaldi.net';
const client = new MongoClient(url);

client.on('commandStarted', (event) => console.debug(event));
client.on('commandSucceeded', (event) => console.debug(event));
client.on('commandFailed', (event) => console.debug(event));

async function main() {
  // Use connect method to connect to the server
  await client.connect();
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');
  const db = client.db(dbName);

  return 'done.';
}

main()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(e => {
    console.error(e)
  })
  .finally(() => client.close());
</code>
</pre>

<p>
After running it I found this at the end of the error message:
</p>

<pre><code>
[cause]: MongoNetworkError: read ECONNRESET
  at TLSSocket.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/rizaldim/tmp/mongodb-srv/nodejs/node_modules/mongodb/lib/cmap/connect.js:285:44)

  errno: -54,
  code: 'ECONNRESET',

}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
TLS? I must have missed something. I was sure that there was no mention of tls
or anything related to that after reading about SRV record or SRV connection
string. After re-reading
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format">the MongoDB docs</a>
I found this:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Use of the +srv connection string modifier automatically
  sets the tls (or the equivalent ssl) option to true for the connection.
  You can override this behavior by explicitly setting the tls
  (or the equivalent ssl) option to false with tls=false (or ssl=false) in the query string.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So it turns out using SRV connection string implies that <code>tls=true</code> in the connection
string. I haven't configured the TLS for my new replica set yet. That's why I
can't connect to it. While the TLS is still not set up, I need to add <code>tls=false</code>
to my connection string.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours getting stuck trying to find out why my setup didn't work.
The key takeaway is always read the docs. Read it thoroughly.
